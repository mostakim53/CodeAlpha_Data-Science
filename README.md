# Irish Data Analysis Project
##ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Species Classification
#Project Overview
This project is a classic machine learning endeavor focused on the Iris flower dataset, which serves as an excellent introductory case study for classification algorithms. The goal is to build a robust model capable of classifying an Iris plant into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica, based on its physical measurements.

#The project follows a standard data science workflow, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

#Features
The dataset contains the following features (in centimeters) for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species:

-SepalLengthCm

-SepalWidthCm

-PetalLengthCm

-PetalWidthCm

-Species (Target variable)

#Methodology and Results
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
The initial steps involved loading and cleaning the data:

Loaded the Iris.csv dataset.

The redundant Id column was dropped.

Data integrity checks confirmed no missing values.

Duplicate rows were checked and handled.

An EDA phase was conducted to understand the distribution of features and the strong positive correlation between PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm.

#2. Machine Learning Model
A Logistic Regression model was selected for the multi-class classification task. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance on unseen data.

#3. Evaluation
The trained model achieved a high level of performance on the test set:

Accuracy Score: 0.93 (93%)

#The classification report indicates excellent precision and recall across all three species, demonstrating the model's capability to generalize well:
| Species | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Iris-setosa | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Iris-versicolor | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.90 |
| Iris-virginica | 0.89 | 0.89 | 0.89 |

##ðŸ“ˆ Unemployment Analysis in India (2019-2021)
#Project Overview
This data science project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of unemployment figures across various regions of India. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize the trends in unemployment, employment, and labor participation rates over a specific period, with a particular focus on the impact of events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the labor market.

The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, which details the full data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization workflow.

#Data Source
The project uses the "Unemployment in India.csv" dataset. The dataset provides monthly estimates for different regions and areas (Rural/Urban).

#Key Features Analyzed:
#Region: State or territory name.

#Date: The month-end date for the recorded data.

#Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): The main target metric, showing the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

#Estimated Employed: The estimated number of people employed.

#Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): The percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for work.

#Analysis and Methodology
The notebook follows a comprehensive data processing pipeline:

#Data Cleaning: The dataset was loaded, and initial checks were performed, including identifying and quantifying missing values.

#Feature Engineering: The Date column was converted to the proper datetime format. New features, Month and Year, were extracted from the date for time-series analysis.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook includes visualizations to understand the distribution and time-series behavior of the key metrics.

#Key Findings & Visualizations
The analysis focuses on temporal and regional comparisons, highlighting the volatility in employment metrics:

COVID Impact Analysis: A specific segment of the analysis investigates the regional unemployment rates during the COVID-19 years (2020 and 2021), allowing for a comparative study of the pandemic's economic effects across different states.

Regional Trends: Visualizations are used to rank regions based on their average unemployment rates to identify areas with the most significant challenges.

#Technologies Used
-Python

-Jupyter Notebook

-pandas and numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

-matplotlib and seaborn: For creating statistical and time-series visualizations (e.g., line plots for time trends and bar charts for regional comparisons).
-scikit-learn for machine learning (Logistic Regression)
