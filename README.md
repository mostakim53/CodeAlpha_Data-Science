# Irish Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the **Irish dataset** using Python. The notebook (`Irish.ipynb`) covers the full data analysis pipeline:
- Data collection & preparation
- Data exploration & summary statistics
- Visualization of key trends and patterns
- Machine learning model to classify
- Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building.
- Basic classification concepts in machine learning.
- Insights & interpretation

The goal is to practice data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model to classify, Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building, basic classification concepts in machine learning. in Jupyter Notebook.
